; Modifying this file:
; You should not modify this file except to make bugfixes or
; for other "maintenance".  If you want to make custom changes
; you should create a new datadir subdirectory and copy this file
; into that directory, and then modify that copy.  Then use the
; command "rulesetdir <mysubdir>" in the server to have freeciv
; use your new customized file.

; Note that the freeciv AI may not cope well with anything more
; than minor changes.

; Below: The individual government types, one per section.
;
; The actual tag used (the * in [government_*]) does not matter, except 
; it must be unique within this file, and it may be used in debug 
; output when reading this file.
;
; For the "official" rulesets, the order of these sections should not
; be changed because that would break backward compatability with 
; savegames.  (In particular, if Fundamentalism is added to default
; ruleset, should be added at end.)
;
; Notes on fields:

; name        = translatable name as seen by user
; rule_name   = (optional) name for savegames, rulesets etc; if not
;               present, 'name' is used. Since the name used in savegames
;               must not change, use this when renaming a government after a
;               ruleset has been released.
; reqs        = requirements for this government (see README.effects)
; graphic     = tag specifing preferred graphic
; graphic_alt = alternate graphics tag if preferred is not found;
;               should be a standard tag if preferred is not;
;		otherwise may be "-"
; ai_better   = AI will not consider this government for use if the
;               government listed here is available
