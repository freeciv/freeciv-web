#     It was committed as a56144bd28e2a19707cee5c5c3028a12c634d0ff

# Not in the upstream Freeciv server
# ----------------------------------
# freeciv_segfauls_fix is a workaround some segfaults in the Freeciv server. Freeciv bug #23884.
# message_escape is a patch for protecting against script injection in the message texts.
# tutorial_ruleset changes the ruleset of the tutorial to one supported by Freeciv-web.
#      - This should be replaced by modification of the tutorial scenario that allows it to
#        work with multiple rulesets (Requires patch #7362 / SVN r33159)
# win_chance includes 'Chance to win' in Freeciv-web map tile popup.
# disable_global_warming is Freeciv bug #24418
# navajo-remove-long-city-names is a quick-fix to remove city names which would be longer than MAX_LEN_NAME
#     when the name is url encoded in json protocol.
#     MAX_LEN_CITYNAME was increased in patch #7305 (SVN r33048)
#     Giving one of the longer removed city names to a new city still causes problems.
# webperimental_install make "make install" install webperimental.
# webgl_vision_cheat_temporary is a temporary solution to reveal terrain types to the WebGL client.
# longturn implements a very basic longturn mode for Freeciv-web.
# load_command_confirmation adds a log message which confirms that loading is complete, so that Freeciv-web can issue additional commands.
# pragma_pack_city_length adds pragma pack to city packet. Also sets MAX_LEN_CITYNAME 50 for large longturn games.
# endgame-mapimg is used to generate a mapimg at endgame for hall of fame.
