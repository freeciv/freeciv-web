; All matched Overlays go in this file.
; This includes rivers, hills, mountains, forest and beaches.
; 
; Note that for matching a hex2 tileset
; the directions are classed as follows:
;
;          west (w)     north (n)
;                  .+'+.
;                 |     |  north-east (ne)
; south-west (sw) |     |
;                  '+,+'
;         south (s)     east (e)
;
; thus tx.s_river_n1ne1e0s0sw1w0  will be connected to other river tiles at the
; top-right, right and left sides.

; cell_type = "rect" does work for a hex tileset, but it still uses rectangles.

;
; The little boxes are what gets drawn. The big boxes are the size of the normal
; drawing tile. The little boxes are each 1/4 the size of the big box.
; The overlap can be dealt with however we want. The area not covered is
; probably not an important part of the tile. If it is, make your
; normal_tile_height bigger.

; the usage of u{xxx} is similar to an isometric tileset.
; The ux1x and dx1x tags are just copies of ux0x and dx0x respectively
; (as with hex-2 the tiles are not connected vertically).
