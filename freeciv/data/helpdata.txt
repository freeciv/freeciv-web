; Each [help_*] is a help node.
;
; 'name' = name of node as shown in help browser; the number of leading 
;          spaces in 'name' indicates nesting level for display.
;
; 'text' = the helptext for this node; can be an array of text, which
;	   are then treated as paragraphs.  (Rationale: easier to update
;	   translations on paragraph level.)
;
; 'generate' = means replace this node with generated list of game
;	       elements; current categories are: 
;	          "Units", "Improvements", "Wonders", "Techs", 
;		  "Terrain", "Governments", "Ruleset"
;
; Within the text, the help engine recognizes a few "generated table"s.  
; These are generated by the help engine, and inserted at the point of 
; reference.  They are referenced by placing a $ in the first column
; of a separate paragraph, followed immediately with the name of the 
; generated table.  See the code in helpdlg.c for the names of tables w
; hich can be referenced.

; This file no longer has a max line length: strings are wrapped

", "\
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your \
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public \
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change \
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. \
This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software \
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit \
to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is \
covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can \
apply it to your programs, too.\
", "\
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not \
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that \
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and \
charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code \
or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or \
use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do \
these things.\
", "\
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid \
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the \
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities \
for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify \
it.\
", "\
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether \
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights \
that you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can \
get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they \
know their rights.\
", "\
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, \
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to \
copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\
", "\
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make \
certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this \
free software.  If the software is modified by someone else and \
passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not \
the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not \
reflect on the original authors' reputations.\
", "\
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software \
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free \
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making \
the program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear \
that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not \
licensed at all.\
", "\
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and \
modification follow.\
", "\
                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION \
", "\
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which \
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be \
distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The \
\"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work \
based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative \
work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the \
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications \
and/or translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation \
is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)  Each \
licensee is addressed as \"you\".\
", "\
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not \
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of \
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the \
Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on \
the Program (independent of having been made by running the \
Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\
", "\
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's \
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you \
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate \
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the \
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any \
warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of \
this License along with the Program.\
", "\
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, \
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for \
a fee.\
", "\
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any \
portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy \
and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section \
1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\
", "\
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices \
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\
", "\
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that \
in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or \
any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all \
third parties under the terms of this License.\
", "\
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively \
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such \
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an \
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a \
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you \
provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program \
under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy \
of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is \
interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, \
your work based on the Program is not required to print an \
announcement.)\
", "\
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If \
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, \
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in \
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those \
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you \
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work \
based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the \
terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend \
to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of \
who wrote it.\
", "\
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or \
contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the \
intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of \
derivative or collective works based on the Program.\
", "\
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the \
Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a \
volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other \
work under the scope of this License.\
", "\
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, \
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms \
of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the \
following:\
", "\
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable \
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of \
Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software \
interchange; or,\
", "\
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three \
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your \
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete \
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be \
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a \
medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\
", "\
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the \
offer to distribute corresponding source code.  (This \
alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and \
only if you received the program in object code or executable \
form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\
", "\
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for \
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source \
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any \
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to \
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as \
a special exception, the source code distributed need not include \
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary \
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the \
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component \
itself accompanies the executable.\
", "\
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering \
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent \
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as \
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not \
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\
", "\
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program \
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt \
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is \
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this \
License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from \
you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so \
long as such parties remain in full compliance.\
", "\
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not \
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or \
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are \
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by \
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the \
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and \
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying \
the Program or works based on it.\
", "\
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on \
the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from \
the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program \
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any \
further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights \
granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by \
third parties to this License.\
", "\
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgement or allegation of \
patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent \
issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, \
agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this \
License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. \
If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your \
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, \
then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. \
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free \
redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies \
directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could \
satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from \
distribution of the Program.\
", "\
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable \
under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is \
intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in \
other circumstances.\
", "\
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any \
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any \
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the \
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is \
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made \
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed \
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that \
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is \
willing to distribute software through any other system and a \
licensee cannot impose that choice.\
", "\
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed \
to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\
", "\
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in \
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, \
the original copyright holder who places the Program under this \
License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation \
excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in \
or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License \
incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this \
License.\
", "\
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new \
versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new \
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may \
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\
", "\
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the \
Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to \
it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the \
terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version \
published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not \
specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version \
ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\
", "\
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other \
free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to \
the author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted \
by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software \
Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision \
will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all \
derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and \
reuse of software generally.\
", "\
                            NO WARRANTY\
", "\
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO \
WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. \
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR \
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY \
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, \
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A \
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND \
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE \
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR \
CORRECTION.\
", "\
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN \
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY \
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU \
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR \
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE \
PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING \
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A \
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF \
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF \
SUCH DAMAGES.\

 4. Building agriculture improvements.\n\

"), _("\
 0. Choosing the first city site.\
\n\n\
    Start the game by wandering around BRIEFLY to find a good place \
to build the first city.  Don't feel tempted to investigate any \
yellow-roofed villages yet - they might contain barbarian \
tribes.  Build the city close to resources and perhaps close to \
the sea.  Keep in mind that the city you build first will be \
your capital!  The idea is to balance the quality of the site you \
find against getting your first city established as early \
as possible.\
"), _("\
 1. Mapping the countryside.\
\n\n\
    After the capital city has been founded, it will start producing \
a warrior unit.  These units can be used to rove around \
exploring the countryside.  Remember, it is risky to leave a \
city undefended, so perhaps keep the first warrior in the city, \
and use the following one to explore.  If you started the game \
with an explorer unit, use that to explore, obviously!\
"), _("\
 2. Defending the cities.\
\n\n\
    At this point, defend your cities by always leaving a warrior \
unit in them.  As your civilization develops units with a \
greater defense strength, replace the obsolete units with new \
ones to ensure your cities have maximum defense.  The units most \
often used for defense are (in order of strength):  Warrior, \
Phalanx, Pikemen, Musketeers, and Riflemen.\
"), ; /* xgettext:no-c-format */
_("\
    Keep in mind that with some types of government, military units \
inside or outside cities can reduce or create unhappiness. \
Also remember that when a unit is inside a city, it gets a 50% \
defensive bonus, as if fortified.  When a new city is built, \
the city starts to build the best available defensive unit from \
the above list.\
"), _("\
 3. Deciding which units to build first.\
\n\n\
    After building one or two Warrior units, start building \
Settlers.  The second Settler can be used to build roads and \
irrigate the farmland close to the city, and the third can be \
used to build a new city.  Or, you can use the second Settler to \
build another city, and use the third Settler for agricultural \
improvements in the farmland around the cities.  Keep in mind \
that a large population increases both the amount of \
productivity and your civilization's research rate.\
"), _("\
 4. Building agriculture improvements.\
\n\n\
    Each city has an area of farmland around it that can be used \
for growing food, producing goods, and generating trade.  This \
can be increased by using Settlers to improve the farmland. \
The land can be improved with roads, irrigation, mines, and \
others.\
"), _("\
 5. Deciding where to build cities.\
\n\n\
    The best location for a city is a matter of taste.  A city which \
is placed near the sea is easier to spot by opponents, but can \
also serve as a port for sea-going units.  (They also usually \
need a coastal defense later on.)  The best strategy is to build \
a few of both, but keep in mind that your opponents will find it \
harder to locate your city if you don't build it by the sea.\

 6. Taking care of the cities.\
\n\n\
    Every city has a band of citizens.  The number of citizens \
depends on the city's population.  When you click on a city, you \
can see how the farmland around the city is being used.  You can \
assign your citizens to the farmland, or they can be scientists, \
entertainers or taxmen.  Especially at the start of the game, \
care should be taken to ensure that the citizens are employed so \
that they maximise growth, trade and production.\

the farmland by clicking on the occupied farmland square.  This \

    The golden rule of taking care of a city is that there should be \
at least as many happy citizens as unhappy citizens.  A city \
where this is not so is labelled with a lightning bolt.  Take \
care not to let this happen to any of your cities, as unhappy \
cities produce nothing, and will soon revolt.\
"), _("\
 7. Exploring the world.\
\n\n\
    After you have fortified your cities with troops, build Triremes \
in the cities near the sea.  Use the Triremes to map the world \
in search of opponents and new lands.  If you are on an island, \
you should spend less on military and more on expansion.  Or if \
you are located close to an opponent, it is truly a good idea to \
make a peace treaty and share the advances you have made. \
Diplomatic units are very useful here, and WILL pay off later.\

you may again lose contact with them a set number of turns after \

declare War, or forge an Alliance. Breaking a Peace treaty will drop you \

[help_governor]
name = _("Citizen Governor")
text = _("\
The Citizen Governor (formerly called the CMA) helps you manage your cities. \
It deploys the available workers on the free tiles around the \
city to achieve maximal city output. It also changes workers to \
scientists, taxmen, or entertainers, if appropriate. And the governor \
has another ability: whenever possible, it keeps \
your cities content.\
\n\n\
There are various means to tell the governor what kind of output you \
would like. Open the city window and click on the governor tab. There \
are two kinds of sliders: On the left, you can set a Minimal \
Surplus for each kind of production; e.g. Gold = +3 means the city \
earns 3 gold more than it needs to upkeep its improvements. On the \
right, the sliders let you define by how much you prefer one kind \
of production to another; setting science to 3 means you prefer a \
single bulb to three shields (or gold, trade,...). You can set \
different factors for each kind of production, according to your \
needs.\
\n\n\
If you set up some Minimal Surpluses which are impossible to fulfill, \
the governor can't be activated. Whenever the governor can't fulfill its task \
in the ongoing game, it passes back control to you. So you'd better \
not define too high a surplus; instead, use factors to achieve your \
goals.\
\n\n\
The Celebrate checkbox lets your city - celebrate. This will work \
only with a high luxury rate. See help about 'Happiness'.\
\n\n\
Clicking on 'Control city' puts the city under control of \
the governor, 'Release city' passes control back to you.\
\n\n\
For ease of use, you can save your slider setting as a preset \
with a name. Click on 'add preset' and enter a name for your \
setting. You can use this preset in every city by just clicking \
on its name. Also, you can control your setting from within the \
city report, in the governor column. And you can change it from there \
(use 'change' --> 'Citizen Governor'), if you have saved it as a preset.\
\n\n\
Use 'Game' --> 'Save Settings' to store your presets \
permanently.\
\n\n\
But beware! If you use the governor for some of your cities, you will \
encounter some difficulties with managing cities nearby, by hand. \
It's best to manage all cities on an island either by hand or by \
governor. Read more hints, some background information, and some \
preset examples in the file README.cma, included with Freeciv.\n\

sea unit carrying them.  Land units are the only units subject to \

for missile units).  The number of turns an air unit can last \
without fuel varies by the unit type (see the individual units). \
Like sea units, air units are unable to enter an empty enemy city \

an air unit in a city with an Airport, will regain all lost hit \
points if a full turn is spent (without moving) in the city. \
Otherwise, a unit which spends a turn in a city regains one third \

any units inside the city, but not if the city is empty. (This is \
the same rule as for any other square).\

ocean square (moving back onto a boat) is also permitted, by the \
