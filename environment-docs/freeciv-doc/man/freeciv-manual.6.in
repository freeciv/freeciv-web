.SH BUGS
This tool is currently only really of use to the Freeciv maintainers,
as a starting point for pages on the main Freeciv wiki; it's not very
useful to end users.

Known shortcomings include that it is missing many ruleset features,
and is hardcoded to output a mixture of MediaWiki markup and HTML.
