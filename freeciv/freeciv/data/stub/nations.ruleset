[default_traits]
; Default values for the AI traits. These are used if nation specific
; value for some trait has not been used. If these default too are
; not defined, the ultimate default is 50.
; <trait>_min and <trait>_max give the range from which the trait value
; is randomly chosen for a given AI player unless 'traitdistribution'
; server setting is 'FIXED'
; <trait>_default is the exaxt trait value used when 'traitdistribution'
; is 'FIXED'. If <trait>_default has not been given, it's set to the
; midpoint between <trait>_min and <trait>_max.

; Value of trait "expansionist" defines how much AI wants to settle new territory.
;expansionist_min = 50
;expansionist_max = 50
;expansionist_default = 50

; Value of trait "trader" defines how much AI wants to establish trade routes.
;trader_min       = 50
;trader_max       = 50
;trader_default   = 50

; Value of trait "aggressive" defines how easily AI declares war.
;aggressive_min   = 50
;aggressive_max   = 50
;aggressive_default = 50

; Descriptions of nation sets
; These are self-contained subsets of the available nations; one of these
; can be chosen in pregame with the "nationset" option. No nations
; outside the selected subset will be used.
; The first set defined is the one that is used by default. It is mandatory
; to have at least one, but if there is only one, it will be kept out of
; the user`s way.
; name 		= Translatable name of the set presented in the UI.
; rule_name     = Unique persistent name; this is also visible to users as
;                 the value of the "nationset" server option, and presented
;                 in "/list nationsets". It should thus be short, in lower
;                 case, and not contain spaces or punctuation.
;                 The same saved "nationset" setting may be used for multiple
;                 rulesets, so if your custom ruleset has any set which
;                 contains all of its nations, it is useful to give it a
;                 rule_name of "all" so that users can specify that they
;                 always want the choice of all available nations by
;                 default.
; description   = Optional short user description of this set.

; Descriptions of nation groups
; These are more cosmetic than sets; they affect the "pick nation" dialog,
; random nation selection, and possibly ruleset behaviour.
; It`s OK to not define any nation groups at all.
; name 		= name of the group (used adjectivally)
; hidden        = TRUE to not include this group in the "pick nation" dialog
;                 (for instance if it's for use in a NationGroup requirement).
;                 Default FALSE.
; match		= How much the AI will try to select a nation in the same
;                 group
