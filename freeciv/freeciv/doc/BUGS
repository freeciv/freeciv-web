This is a beta release and may contain bugs.  Much of the following text
applies to the upcoming stable release!  Please report all bugs to
http://bugs.freeciv.org/.


REPORTING A BUG:
================

Here's what to do:

 - Check that it is not listed as a known bug! For a continuously
   updated list, see:

        http://www.freeciv.org/wiki/Known_Bugs

 - Check the Freeciv website, to ensure you're playing the latest
   version.  (We may have already fixed the problem.)

 - Check the Freeciv Bug Tracking System at:

        http://bugs.freeciv.org/

   to see if the bug has already been reported.

 - Submit a bug report through our bug tracking system above!

   If you get any GDK/GTK messages, as for example:

     Gtk-CRITICAL **: file gtkobject.c: line 1163 (gtk_object_ref): 
     assertion oject->ref_count > 0' failed.

   please restart your client and append "-- --g-fatal-warnings" to
   the command line. You will get a core dump this way. Please include
   the "stack trace" of this core dump in your bug report.

   What to include in your bug report:

   - Describe the problem, including any messages that were displayed.

   - Indicate which client(s) you are using (GTK+, SDL, Win32, or Xaw).

   - Tell us the name and version of:

       - The Operating System you're using.  You may find the
         "uname -a" command useful.

       - The version number of Freeciv.

       - If you are using the GTK+ client, the version numbers
         (if you know them) of your GTK+, GLib, and imlib libraries.

       - If you are using the SDL client, the version numbers (if you
         know them) of the SDL, SDL_image, PNG, and freetype libraries.

       - If you are using the Xaw client, the version numbers (if you
         know them) of the X libraries, the PNG library, the Z library,
         and the Xaw library, and particularly whether it is standard
         Xaw, or a variant such as Xaw3d, Xaw95, or Nextaw.

       - If you're compiling from source code, the name
         and version number of the compiler.

       - If you're installing from a binary package, the name of
         the package, the distribution it's for, and where you
         got it from.

   - If Freeciv "dumps core", then we may ask you to use a debugger to
     give us a "stack trace".  You'll need the "core" file for this as
     well as the binary which you used, so please backup both.

   - If it is a bug in a translation, it should be reported to the
     Primary Contact for the language.  For their names and addresses,
     see:

        http://www.freeciv.org/wiki/Localization
