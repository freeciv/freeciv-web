 Freeciv Style Guide
===========================================================================

If you want to hack Freeciv, and want your patches to be accepted, it
helps to follow some simple style rules. Yes, some of these are a bit 
nit-picky, but wars are fought over the silliest things...

- Freeciv is programmed in plain C (except the BEOS client). This
  means that C++ features like:
    - C++-style comments (i.e., // comments) and
    - declaration variables in the middle of the function body
  are forbidden.

- Use K&R indentation style with indentation 2 (if in doubt, use
  "indent -kr -i2 -l77").  However, do not re-indent areas of code you
  are not modifying or creating. Here are the most important properties:
    - lines are at most 77 chars long
    - spaces are inserted before and after operators (instead of 
      "int a,b,c;" use "int i, j, k;" and instead of "if(foo<=bar) c=a+b;"
      use "if (foo <= bar) c = a + b;" -- note the space between "if" 
      and the bracket)
    - function braces begin and end in the first column.
        int foo()
        {
          return 0;
        }
      instead of
        int foo() {
          return 0;
        }
    - the tab width is 8
    - the indentation is 2 columns per level

- An empty line should be placed between two separate blocks of code.

- Place operators at the beginning of a line, not at the end.  It should be
    if ((a
         && b)
        || c) {
  instead of
    if ((a &&
         b) ||
        c) {

================================
 Comments
================================

- Every function should have a comment header.  The comment should look 
  like the example below, indented by two spaces.  It should be above the 
  function's implementation, not the prototype:

/*************************************************************************
  the description of the function should be here
  any information is helpful, such as who calls this function, etc.
  do _not_ introduce a new function without some sort of comment.
*************************************************************************/
int the_function_starts_here(int value) 
{
  ...
}

- One line comments. Comments should be indented correctly and 
  placed above the code being commented upon:

  int x;

  /* I am a single line comment */
  x = 3;

- Multiline comments. Asterisks should be placed in front of the 
  comment line like so:

  /* I am a multiline
   * comment, blah 
   * blah blah */

- Comments in declarations. If you need to comment a declared variable,
  it should be as such:

  struct foo {
    int bar;                    /* bar is used for ....
                                 * in ..... way */
    int blah;                   /* blah is used for .... */
  };

- Comments in conditionals. If you need a comment to show program flow,
  it should be below the if or else:

  if (is_barbarian(pplayer)) {
    x++;
  } else {
    /* If not barbarian, ... */
    x--;
  }

- Comments to translators are stored before the N_(), _() or Q_() marked
  string, and are preceded by "TRANS:".  These comments are copied to the
  translators file.  Use them whenever you think the translators may need
  some more information:

    /* TRANS: Don't translate "commandname". */
    printf(_("commandname <arg> [-o <optarg>]"));

================================
 Declaring variables
================================

- Variables can be initialized as soon as they're declared:

int foo(struct unit *punit)
{
  int x = punit->x;
  int foo = x;
  char *blah;

  ...
}

- After variables are declared, there should be an empty line before the
  rest of the function body.

- Merging declarations. Variables do not have to be declared one per line;
  however, they should only be grouped by similar function.

int foo(struct city *pcity)
{
  int i, j, k;
  int total, cost;
  int build = pcity->shield_stock;
}

================================
 Bracing
================================

- Extra braces on iterates. Note that the *_iterate_end; should be placed 
  on the same line as the end brace:

  unit_list_iterate(pcity->units_supported, punit) {
    kill(punit);
  } unit_list_iterate_end;

- In switch statements, braces should only be placed where needed, i.e. to
  protect local variables.

- Braces shall be used after conditionals:

  if (x == 3) {
    return;
  }

 and 

  if (x == 3) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return 0;
  }

 not

  if (x == 3)
    return 1;  /* BAD! */

================================
 Other stuff
================================

- If an empty block is needed you should put an explanatory comment in
  an empty block (i.e. {}):

  while (*i++) {
    /* nothing */
  }

- Use the postfix operator instead of the prefix operator when either will
  work.  That is, write "a++" instead of "++a".

- Order include files consistently: All includes are grouped
  together. These groups are divided by an empty line. The order of
  these groups are as follow:

    1) config.h (see below)
    2) system include files which are OS-independent (part of
       C-standard or POSIX)
    3) system include files which are OS-dependent or conditional
       includes
    4) include files from common/ and common/aicore
    5) include files from client/, client/include and client/agents
    6) include files from client/gui-*
    7) include files from server/
    8) include files from ai/

  Each group is sorted in alphabetic order. This helps to avoid adding
  unnecessary or duplicated include files.

  It is very important that '#include <config.h>' be included at the top of
  every .c file (it need not be included from .h files).  Some definitions in
  config.h will affect how the code is compiled, without which you can end
  up with bad and untraceable memory bugs.

- If you use a system specific feature, don't add #ifdef __CRAY__ or
  something like that.  Rather write a check for that feature for
  configure.ac, and use a meaningful macro name in the source.

- Always prototype global functions in the appropriate header file.
  Local functions should always be declared as static. To catch these
  and some other problems please use the following warning options
  "-Wall -Wpointer-arith -Wcast-align -Wmissing-prototypes
  -Wmissing-declarations -Wstrict-prototypes -Wnested-externs" if you
  use gcc.

- Header files should be compatible with C++ but code (.c) files need not
  be.  This means some C++ keywords (like "this" or "class") may not be
  used in header files.  It also means casts on void pointers (which should
  be avoided in C files) must be used in headers.

- If you send patches, use "diff -u" (or "diff -r -u"). "svn diff" works
  correctly without extra parameters.
  For further information, see
  <http://www.freeciv.org/index.php/How_to_Contribute>.
  Also, name patch files descriptively (e.g. "fix-foo-bug-0.diff" is good,
  but "freeciv.diff" is not).

- When doing a "diff" for a patch, be sure to exclude unnecessary files
  by using the "-X" argument to "diff".  E.g.:

    % diff -ruN -Xdiff_ignore freeciv_svn freeciv >/tmp/fix-foo-bug-0.diff

  A suggested "diff_ignore" file is included in the Freeciv distribution.
