Max used id:
============

Max id: 255

Packets are not ordered by their id, but by their category. New packet
with higher id may get added to existing category, and not to the end of file.
For this reason it's important to keep information about max id currently
in use updated here. So we know what ids are safe to use when adding new
packets.

Range 256:511 is reserved for freeciv-web specific packets.


Syntax:

 Comments:
 =========

  Supported are: c-style (/ * * /), c++-style (//) and python style
  (#). Empty lines will be ignored.

 Typedef lines:
 ==============
 
  Start with "type" and have the format "type <alias> = <src>". You
  can now use <alias> at every place a type is expected. Nested type
  defs are possible.
  freeciv-web build does not like comments on the end of the line.
  Please put comments to lines of their own.

 Packets:
 ========

  A packet definition starts with a header line, contains variable
  field declarations, and ends with a single line containing the word
  "end".
   
   PACKET_<PACKET_NAME>=<packet num>; [<packet flags>]
     <type1> <field1>; [<field flags>]
     <type2> <field2>; [<field flags>]
     ...
   end

   Header line:
   ------------

    The header line contains the packet name. The packet name is used
    for the naming of the generated code struct and functions:
      struct packet_*;
      send_packet_*
      dsend_packet_*
      dlsend_packet_*
      lsend_packet_*
      receive_packet_*
      handle_packet_*

    The header line also contains the packet number. The packet number
    is used as a numeric identification of a packet between the client
    and server. The packet number shall never change for an existing
    packet without the adding of a mandatory capability. Packets which
    are used for the capability checking PACKET_PROCESSING_STARTED,
    PACKET_PROCESSING_FINISHED, PACKET_SERVER_JOIN_REQ and
    PACKET_SERVER_JOIN_REPLY are excluded here. These packets should
    never change their number. The packet number can be freely chosen
    as long as it is below 65536 and unique. For backward compatibility  
    reasons, packets used for the initial protocol (notably before
    checking the capabilities) must be in range 0-255.

   Packet flags:
   -------------

    Packet flags is a comma separated list of:

     is-info: a second packet with the same content can be discarded
              WARNING: this flag is dangerous and should not be used for
              a packet that contains information that may be changed in
              the client outside of the reception of that packet, or for
              any packet with side effects at the client.

     is-game-info: same as is-info, but the state is reset every time a
                   connection changes of player target.

     force: sending functions will take an extra argument 'force_to_send'
            to force to send the packet (at least an empty one). In this
            case, the is-info or is-game-info flags are ignored. It has no
            effect if the packets doesn't have the is-info or is-game-info
            flags.

     cancel(PACKET_number): Cancel a packet with the same key (must be the
     same key type at the start of the packet), useful for is-info packets.

     pre-send:
     post-recv:
     post-send: generate calls to pre-send, post-receive and post-send
     hooks. These hooks are named: pre_send_packet_*,
     post_receive_packet_* and post_send_packet_*. The user has to
     provide these. These functions may be used to do extra
     preparations, conversions or checks.

     no-delta: don't use the delta protocol. This is useful for
     packets which contain always different data
     (packet_generic_integer) or are only sent once
     (packet_req_join_game). Sadly this also disables the use of 0 as
     the default value.

     no-packet: don't generate a packet argument for the send
     function. Currently only used by packet_generic_empty.

     no-handle: don't generate handle_* prototypes. The generated
     switch statements (server/srv_main_gen.c, client/civclient_gen.c)
     doesn't include code for this packet. You have to handle this by
     yourself. This may be required for special packets which are
     handled early in the sequence.

     handle-via-packet: force the packet type of the handle
     function. Otherwise the fields are passed to the handle function.
     This is invoked automatically for packets with more than 5 fields
     or packets whose names are of the form foo_ruleset.

     handle-per-conn: normally the first parameter of the handle
     function is the player. handle-per-conn changes this to the
     connection the packet came from.

     dsend: request the creation of a dsend_packet_* function.  This is
     similar to a send function but instead of taking a packet struct
     as a parameter, it takes the fields of the packet as parameters.

     lsend: request the creation of a lsend_packet_* function.  This
     function sends to list of connections instead of just one 
     connection, which is the case for the other send functions.

     cs: a packet which is sent from the client to the server

     sc: a packet which is sent from the server to the client

  Each other packet line has the format "<type> <fields>;<flags>".

    Type:
    ----

      <type> is an alias or a basic type. A basic type has the format
      "<dataio-type>(<public-type>)". Exception here is the float
      type. You can specify with the dataio-type "float<number>" the
      transmission of a float in a uint32 multiplied by this factor.

    Fields:
    -------

      Comma seperated list of names. Each name can have zero, one or
      two array declarations. So "x", "x[10]" and "x[20][10]" is
      possible. The array size in the "[]" can be specified plain as a
      term. In this case all elements will be transmitted. If this is
      not-desired you can specify the amount of elements to be
      transfered by given the number. So the extended format is
      "[<full-array-size>:<elements-to-transfer>]". elements-to-transfer
      is relative to the packet.

   Field flags:
   ------------

      key: create multiple entries in the cache indexed by the key set
      (set of all fields which have the key attribute). This allow a
      better delta compression.

      diff: use the array-diff feature. This will reduce the amount of
      traffic for large arrays in which only a few elements change.

      add-cap: only transfer this field if the given capability is
      available at runtime. If you have a capability named
      "new_version" a field line may look like this:
        TILE tile; add-cap(new_version)
      when making an optional capability mandatory, go through and remove
      the add-cap flag for it while leaving the field intact.

      remove-cap: don't transfer this field if the given capability is
      available at runtime.  When making an optional capability manditory,
      go through and remove entirely any fields marked as remove-cap with
      that capability.
