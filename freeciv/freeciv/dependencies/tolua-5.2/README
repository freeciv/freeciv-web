* What is tolua?
  tolua is a tool that greatly simplifies the integration of C/C++ code 
  with Lua. Based on a "cleaned" header file, tolua automatically generates 
  the binding code to access C/C++ features from Lua. Using Lua API and
  tag method facilities, the current version automatically maps C/C++ 
  constants, external variables, functions, namespace, classes, and methods 
		to Lua. It also provides facilities to create Lua modules.
