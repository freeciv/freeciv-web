Freeciv is a turn-based strategy game, in which each player becomes \
the leader of a civilization. You compete against several opponents to \
found cities, use them to support a military and economy, and finally \
to complete an empire that survives all encounters with its neighbors \
to emerge victorious. Each opponent may be either another human or be \
controlled by the computer. All players begin at the dawn of history \
with a handful of units -- typically with an explorer and a couple of \
settlers in 4000 BCE -- and race to expand outward from those humble \
beginnings.\
"), _("\
Achieving success requires a balance between economic expansion, \
military strength, and technological development. Not only must you \
develop all three in concert to both expand and successfully defend \
your empire, but any of the three may provide victory over your \
opponents:\
"), _("\
 - As in other games of conquest and expansion, you are declared the \
winner by default once the last city and unit of every other \
civilization is destroyed.\
"), _("\
 - Once technological progress has brought you into the space age, \
you may launch a spacecraft destined for Alpha Centauri; the \
first civilization whose craft reaches the system wins.\
"), _("\
 - In the absence of other means to determine victory, the game will \
end after 5000 turns if no spacecraft have yet been launched. The \
surviving civilizations are then rated, and the one with the highest \
score is the winner.\
"), _("\
A word of warning: Freeciv is highly customizable, both through \
run-time configuration and through custom rulesets which can change \
almost any aspect of the game rules. This help system tries to adapt \
to different rules, but may not completely cover rulesets which are \
very different from the classic rules.\
")

[help_strategy_and_tactics]
name = _("Strategy and Tactics")
text = _("\
While every game is different, there's a basic strategy which most \
players follow, especially at the start of the game.\
"), _("\
These steps may vary depending upon the server options, but in \
general, the steps are: \
"), _("\
 0. Choosing the first city site.\n\
 1. Mapping the countryside.\n\
 2. Defending the cities.\n\
 3. Deciding which units to build first.\n\
 4. Improving the land.\n\
 5. Deciding where to build cities.\n\
 6. Taking care of the cities.\n\
 7. Interacting with other players (diplomacy).\n\
 8. Exploring the world.\n\
 9. Things to keep in mind.\n\
10. Making your own strategy for the game.\n\
"), _("\
 0. Choosing the first city site.\
\n\n\
    Start the game by wandering around BRIEFLY to find a good place \
to build the first city.  Don't feel tempted to investigate any \
yellow-roofed villages yet - they might contain barbarian \
tribes.  Build the city close to resources and perhaps close to \
the sea.  Keep in mind that the city you build first will be \
your capital!  The idea is to balance the quality of the site you \
find against getting your first city established as early \
as possible.\
"), _("\
 1. Mapping the countryside.\
\n\n\
    After the capital city has been founded, it will start producing \
a warrior unit.  These units can be used to rove around \
exploring the countryside.  Remember, it is risky to leave a \
city undefended, so perhaps keep the first warrior in the city, \
and use the following one to explore.  If you started the game \
with an explorer unit, use that to explore, obviously!\
"), _("\
 2. Defending the cities.\
\n\n\
    At this point, defend your cities by always leaving a warrior \
unit in them.  As your civilization develops units with a \
greater defense strength, replace the obsolete units with new \
ones to ensure your cities have maximum defense.  The units most \
often used for defense are (in order of strength):  Warrior, \
Phalanx, Pikemen, Musketeers, and Riflemen.\
"), ; /* xgettext:no-c-format */
_("\
    Keep in mind that with some types of government, military units \
inside or outside cities can reduce or create unhappiness. \
Also remember that when a land unit is inside a city, it gets a 50% \
defensive bonus, as if fortified.  When a new city is built, \
the city starts to build the best available defensive unit from \
the above list.\
"), _("\
 3. Deciding which units to build first.\
\n\n\
    After building one or two Warrior units, start building \
Settlers.  Settlers are best put to use founding new cities; \
while they can also build agricultural improvements (see the \
next section), it is better to use Workers for this when \
available, as unlike Settlers, Workers do not consume food from \
their parent city.  Keep in mind that a large population increases \
both the amount of productivity and your civilization's research \
rate, not to mention that cities secure land for your empire, \
so founding new cities should be a high priority initially.\
"), _("\
 4. Improving the land.\
\n\n\
    Each city has an area of land around it that can be used \
for growing food, producing goods, and generating trade.  This output \
can be increased by using Workers (or Settlers) to improve the land \
close to your cities.  The land can be improved with irrigation \
(increasing food), roads (allowing units to move faster and \
increasing trade), and mines (increasing production), among other \
improvements.\
"), _("\
 5. Deciding where to build cities.\
\n\n\
    The best location for a city is a matter of taste.  A city which \
is placed near the sea is easier to spot by opponents, but can \
also serve as a port for sea-going units.  (They also usually \
need a coastal defense later on.)  The best strategy is to build \
a few of both, but keep in mind that your opponents will find it \
harder to locate your city if you don't build it by the sea.\
"), _("\
 6. Taking care of the cities.\
\n\n\
    Every city has a band of citizens.  The number of citizens \
depends on the city's population.  When you click on a city, you \
can see how the land around the city is being used.  You can \
assign your citizens to the land, or they can be specialists that \
contribute to your civilization in other ways.  Especially at the \
start of the game, care should be taken to ensure that the citizens \
are employed so that they maximize growth, trade and production.\
"), _("\
    If too much food is being generated, a citizen can be taken off \
the land by clicking on the occupied land tile.  This \
citizen can then be transferred to the other duties mentioned \
previously.\
"), _("\
    If you move all of your citizens into the city and right-click \
on the central tile of the land, the citizens will be \
rearranged to maximize food production.\
"), 
;     Above: probably some other AI maximization choice now  --dwp
_("\
    The golden rule of taking care of a city is that there should be \
at least as many happy citizens as unhappy citizens.  A city \
where this is not so falls into disorder; such cities are labeled \
with a raised fist or a lightning bolt (depending on the tileset).  \
Take care not to let this happen to any of your cities, as cities in \
disorder produce nothing, and are prone to revolt.\
"), _("\
 7. Interacting with other players (diplomacy).\
\n\n\
    When one of your units first meets a unit of another nation, or \
finds one of their cities (or equally if they find you), a basic \
contact is established between the two nations.  This provides each \
with basic intelligence about the other, which can be accessed from \
the 'Nations' report.\
"), _("\
    This communication will lapse after a set number of turns with \
no contact.  Establishing an embassy will give a more permanent \
communication channel, as well as more advanced intelligence such \
as details of technology.  Embassies are one-way - the nation \
hosting the embassy receives no benefit - and once established, \
cannot be revoked.\
"), _("\
    If you are in contact with another player, then you can arrange \
a diplomatic meeting.  From the 'Nations' report, this is done by \
clicking on the nation with whom you wish to meet and selecting \
'Meet'.  If the entry under the embassy column is not blank and the \
other player is connected (or is a server AI) then a treaty dialog \
will pop up.\
"), _("\
    In this dialog you can negotiate an exchange of assets (maps, \
vision, advances, cities, or gold), embassies, or binding pacts \
such as a cease-fire or peace.  There is no need to trade like for \
like; you can trade, say, an advance or city for gold - you can \
consider this buying and selling.\
"), _("\
    Pacts affect where your units can go and what they can do, \
and a pact with one nation can affect your relations with others.  \
Under authoritarian governments such as Monarchy you can break a \
pact at any time, but the representative governments (Republic and \
Democracy) have a senate which will block the unprovoked \
cancelation of a treaty; unless a foreign Diplomat or Spy sparks \
a diplomatic incident, the only way to dissolve a pact in this \
situation is to dissolve your government.  The details of pacts are \
described in the Diplomacy section.\
"), _("\
    A couple of notes:\
"), _("\
   - You can't give away your capital.\
"), _("\
   - You can only request property that you know about; so you \
can't request technology unless you have an embassy, and if \
you can't see a city on your map, then you can't request it.  \
Of course, the owner of that city can still offer it to \
you, in which case the area around the city is shown \
on your map before you accept the treaty.\
"), _("\
   - One important thing to note: when a city is transferred, \
any units in the field and supported by that city are also \
transferred (but not those sitting in other cities).  So make \
sure the other player isn't getting a better deal than you expect.\
"), _("\
 8. Exploring the world.\
\n\n\
    After you have fortified your cities with troops, build Triremes \
in the cities near the sea.  Use the Triremes to map the world \
in search of opponents and new lands.  If you are on an island, \
you should spend less on military and more on expansion.  Or if \
you are located close to an opponent, it is truly a good idea to \
make a peace treaty and share the advances you have made. \
Diplomatic units are very useful here, and WILL pay off later.\
"), _("\
 9. Things to keep in mind.\
\n\n\
  - What the next advance you'll need is.\
\n\n\
  - What your tax, luxury and research rates are currently set to.\
\n\n\
  - Treaties are often broken, so don't neglect defense...\
\n\n\
  - Some wonders can be made obsolete.\
"), _("\
 10. Making your own strategy for the game.\
\n\n\
    These basic concepts will allow you to play the game pretty \
well, especially in the beginning of the game.  But to improve, \
you need to study the various units and advances, and PRACTICE, \
PRACTICE, PRACTICE!  Freeciv has many twists, so if you haven't \
played a similar game before, try consulting the Freeciv WWW \

Terrain affects combat very simply: when a unit is attacked, its \

food, production, and trade points, and the quantity of each produced \

between: for example, \"1/2/0\" describes a tile that each turn when \
it is being worked produces one food point, two production points, and \
no trade points. In addition to the characteristic output of the \
terrain, some tiles have an additional special resource that boosts \
one or two of the products. See the Economy section for more \
information on the use of these products.\

Certain units have the ability to alter terrain tiles in several \
ways: they may add or remove tile improvements, remove unwanted \
features such as pollution, or change the base terrain type entirely.\
"), _("\
Tile improvements typically provide some lasting bonus for as long as \
they are present, such as a production bonus when a city works the \
tile. Roads or paths typically ease movement, if they connect to a \
similar road on an adjacent tile, and bases often provide protection \
and refueling. The available tile improvements are described in the \
following sections.\
"), _("\
Improvements can be built by issuing one of several orders to a suitable \
unit while on a suitable tile: \"mine\", \"irrigate\", \"road\", or \
\"build base\" (although whether the order builds an improvement of the \
same name is up to the ruleset).\
"), _("\
Terrain can sometimes be permanently converted into a type more suitable \
to the player's needs, although this usually takes longer than adding \
an improvement. Converting terrain from one type to another in this way \
may destroy existing improvements, if the new terrain is unsuitable, and \
may also remove access to special resources if they were specific to \
the original terrain type.\
"), _("\
The requirements for terrain conversion are set by the ruleset. \
It can be initiated in several ways:\
"), _("\
 - By issuing \"irrigate\" or \"mine\" orders when on terrain unsuitable \
for tile improvements.\
"), _("\
 - By issuing the special \"transform\" order. This often causes more \
radical transformations.\
"), _("\
In some rulesets, units can even reclaim land from water tiles, and \
similarly land can be transformed to water, although such radical \
transformations may require a certain number of surrounding tiles to \
already be land or water respectively. Terrain-altering units that \
cannot reach the existing terrain may have to be loaded onto a \
suitable vessel, and if necessary and possible, they will move to \
safe neighboring tiles when the conversion is complete.\
"), _("\
Units may also be able to destroy terrain alterations, by pillaging; \
typically more kinds of unit can pillage an improvement than \
could build it in the first place. Some tile features can only be \
removed by specialized units, with the \"clean pollution\" or \
\"clean fallout\" orders.\
"), _("\
Terrain conversions cannot be undone in this way; for example, in the \
classic ruleset, if a Forest tile has been irrigated to convert it into \
Plains, you cannot convert it back into a Forest by pillaging -- to do \
so, you would have to convert the tile again with a suitable unit.\
"), _("\
The time it takes a unit to alter terrain depends on its movement rate. \
The following table shows the number of turns required for a unit \
with 1 movement point to complete an activity; these numbers are \
reduced for units with faster move rates (such as Engineers in the \
classic ruleset). The time taken can be reduced further by several units \
working together as a team; if two or more units are working on the same \
task on the same tile, their efforts will be added together each turn \
until the task is finished. Be careful not to dedicate too many units \
to one task, though; excess effort can be wasted, and groups of terrain \
improving units are often vulnerable to enemy attacks.\

section on Happiness). Borders also come into play when there is a \
diplomatic pact between nations (see the section on Diplomacy).\
"), _("\
Founding a city establishes a claim on an area of land around the \
city. In the classic ruleset, once claimed, a tile that can be directly \
worked by a city can not change ownership unless the city does (or is \
destroyed). However, the ownership of land that is out of range of any \
city can change depending on factors such as the relative size of nearby \
nations' cities. Other rulesets may differ in which, if any, tiles are \
permanently claimed by a city.\

a Granary in the classic ruleset only enhances this capability). \

their granary, while those producing less than they require deplete \
their granary. When food is needed but none remains, the city \
population starves, killing food-consuming units first, followed by \
citizens, until the food deficit ends.\
"), _("\
Excess food can increase the population: the city granary has a \
limited capacity, and once full the city grows by one citizen and the \
granary starts again at empty. But since granary capacity increases \

production drops too low, the units that cannot be supported are \
automatically disbanded. Most types of unit can also be disbanded at \
any time. If a unit is disbanded while in a city, half of its production \
cost will usually be put towards that city's surplus.\

Production points in excess of any required by the city's units are \

accumulate until the cost of the product has been achieved. Products \
appear in their city when complete -- units appear on the map while \
improvements and wonders are added to their city's list of structures. \
Any leftover production points remain available to be applied towards \
the next project.\

In the classic ruleset, a city can build at most one product per turn, \
regardless of its production surplus. However, in some rulesets, \
factors such as city size and technology may enable a single city to \
produce more than one unit in a single turn under certain conditions. \
A city with multiple \"build slots\", ordered to build a unit, can build \
as many of that single kind of unit per turn as its production surplus \
allows, up to the number of slots. Units which cost city population to \
build are an exception to this rule; they can only be built singly, as \
can buildings.\
"), _("\
A city can be given a list of several products to build in its \
\"worklist\", avoiding the need to pay attention to it every few \
turns. Each item on the worklist represents a single product (such as \
a unit); the city will work through them in order. When a city has \
finished all the work you have given it to do, it will try to build \
the last item again if possible, otherwise it will choose a new target \
itself. If a city is currently producing gold (building Coinage in the \
classic rules), an activity which never completes, putting an item on \
its worklist will cause it to stop producing gold and start working on \
the new item next turn. In rulesets which permit it, a city may take \
several units of the same type off its worklist in a single turn, but \
if a different kind of item is reached, production pauses until the \

valuable resources around an enemy city. Units can also be ordered to \
pillage, which damages improvements. Worker units could even transform \

for free, without being assigned a citizen. The city's tile may also \
receive other benefits. In the classic ruleset, it always produces at \

enemy agents to incite to revolt. Prolonged disorder under certain \
governments can lead to a spontaneous national revolution, \
overthrowing your government.\

It should be stressed that only citizens working the land vary in \
morale -- specialists enjoy enough privilege to remain perpetually \

four terrain tiles at once, the problem of morale must be confronted \
more directly.\

There are many ways of making unhappy citizens content, which does \
prevent disorder but is without further benefit. Producing happy \

benefits.\

", "\
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your \
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public \
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change \
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. \
This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software \
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit \
to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is \
covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can \
apply it to your programs, too.\
", "\
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not \
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that \
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and \
charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code \
or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or \
use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do \
these things.\
", "\
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid \
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the \
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities \
for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify \
it.\
", "\
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether \
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights \
that you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can \
get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they \
know their rights.\
", "\
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, \
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to \
copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\
", "\
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make \
certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this \
free software.  If the software is modified by someone else and \
passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not \
the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not \
reflect on the original authors' reputations.\
", "\
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software \
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free \
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making \
the program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear \
that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not \
licensed at all.\
", "\
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and \
modification follow.\
", "\
                     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION \
", "\
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which \
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be \
distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The \
\"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work \
based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative \
work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the \
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications \
and/or translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation \
is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)  Each \
licensee is addressed as \"you\".\
", "\
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not \
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of \
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the \
Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on \
the Program (independent of having been made by running the \
Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\
", "\
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's \
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you \
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate \
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the \
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any \
warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of \
this License along with the Program.\
", "\
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, \
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for \
a fee.\
", "\
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any \
portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy \
and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section \
1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\
", "\
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices \
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\
", "\
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that \
in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or \
any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all \
third parties under the terms of this License.\
", "\
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively \
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such \
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an \
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a \
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you \
provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program \
under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy \
of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is \
interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, \
your work based on the Program is not required to print an \
announcement.)\
", "\
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If \
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, \
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in \
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those \
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you \
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work \
based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the \
terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend \
to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of \
who wrote it.\
", "\
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or \
contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the \
intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of \
derivative or collective works based on the Program.\
", "\
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the \
Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a \
volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other \
work under the scope of this License.\
", "\
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, \
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms \
of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the \
following:\
", "\
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable \
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of \
Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software \
interchange; or,\
", "\
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three \
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your \
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete \
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be \
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a \
medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\
", "\
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the \
offer to distribute corresponding source code.  (This \
alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and \
only if you received the program in object code or executable \
form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\
", "\
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for \
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source \
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any \
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to \
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as \
a special exception, the source code distributed need not include \
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary \
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the \
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component \
itself accompanies the executable.\
", "\
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering \
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent \
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as \
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not \
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\
", "\
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program \
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt \
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is \
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this \
License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from \
you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so \
long as such parties remain in full compliance.\
", "\
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not \
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or \
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are \
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by \
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the \
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and \
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying \
the Program or works based on it.\
", "\
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on \
the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from \
the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program \
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any \
further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights \
granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by \
third parties to this License.\
", "\
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgement or allegation of \
patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent \
issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, \
agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this \
License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. \
If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your \
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, \
then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. \
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free \
redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies \
directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could \
satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from \
distribution of the Program.\
", "\
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable \
under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is \
intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in \
other circumstances.\
", "\
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any \
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any \
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the \
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is \
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made \
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed \
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that \
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is \
willing to distribute software through any other system and a \
licensee cannot impose that choice.\
", "\
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed \
to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\
", "\
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in \
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, \
the original copyright holder who places the Program under this \
License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation \
excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in \
or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License \
incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this \
License.\
", "\
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new \
versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new \
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may \
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\
", "\
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the \
Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to \
it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the \
terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version \
published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not \
specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version \
ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\
", "\
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other \
free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to \
the author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted \
by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software \
Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision \
will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all \
derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and \
reuse of software generally.\
", "\
                             NO WARRANTY\
", "\
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO \
WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. \
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR \
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY \
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, \
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A \
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND \
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE \
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR \
CORRECTION.\
", "\
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN \
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY \
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU \
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR \
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE \
PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING \
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A \
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF \
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF \
SUCH DAMAGES.\
