.SH DESCRIPTION
Freeciv is a free turn-based multiplayer strategy game, in which each player
becomes the leader of a civilization, fighting to obtain the ultimate goal:
To become the greatest civilization.

Players of Civilization II\*R by Microprose\*R should feel at home, since one
aim of Freeciv is to have compatible rules.

Freeciv is maintained by an international team of coders and enthusiasts, and is
easily one of the most fun and addictive network games out there!

This is the client program used to connect to a Freeciv server - see also
.IR freeciv-server (6)
\&. \fBfreeciv-gtk3\fP, \fBfreeciv-gtk3.22\fP, \fBfreeciv-qt\fP, and
\fBfreeciv-sdl2\fP
can also spawn their own local server for single-player games.

This manual page only lists the command line arguments. For more details
about using \fBfreeciv-gtk3\fP, \fBfreeciv-gtk3.22\fP,
\fBfreeciv-sdl2\fP, or \fBfreeciv-qt\fP,
see the Client Manual which can be found at
.UR @WIKI_URL@
the Freeciv website
.UE
as well as the documentation which is part of the Freeciv distribution.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are accepted by all clients. They may not
be combined; that is, "\-np caesar 5557" will not work, instead you
would need to enter "\-n caesar \-p 5557". All options have a short
form (single hyphen and single letter) and a long form (double hyphen
and a complete word); their effects are identical.
.TP
.BI "\-A \fIprotocol\fP, \-\-Announce \fIprotocol\fP"
Uses \fIprotocol\fP when searching for games on a LAN.
Possible values for \fIprotocol\fP are:

\fBIPv4\fP

\fBIPv6\fP

\fBnone\fP
.TP
.BI "\-a, \-\-autoconnect"
Skips the connect dialog, automatically inserting the default values. This is
quite convenient when all has been set up properly.
.TP
.BI "\-d \fIlevel_number\fP, \-\-debug \fIlevel_number\fP"
Sets the amount of debugging information to be logged in the file named by the
.I \-l
option. Acceptable values for the \fIlevel_number\fP are:

\fB0\fP    for fatal messages only.

\fB1\fP    for fatal and error messages.

\fB2\fP    for fatal, error and warning messages

\fB3\fP    for fatal, error, warning and normal messages (default).

\fB4\fP    for fatal, error, warning, normal, and verbose messages.

.TP
.BI "\-F [ \fIsignal_number\fP ], \-\-Fatal [ \fIsignal_number\fP ]"
Raise a custom signal on failed assertion.  If \fIsignal_number\fP is not
specified, then the ABRT signal will be used.
.TP
.BI "\-f \fIfilename\fP, \-\-file \fIfilename\fP"
Loads a saved game file (\fIfilename\fP). This is for reloading previously
saved games, or for starting scenarios from the command line.
.TP
.BI "\-h, \-\-help"
Prints a short summary of the standard command line options.
.TP
.BI "\-l \fIfilename\fP, \-\-log \fIfilename\fP"
Defines a log file, \fIfilename\fP, to be produced during processing. Use the
.I \-d
option to set how much is logged.  By default, fatal, error, and normal
messages are printed to standard output.  With a log file, such messages go
to the log instead.  If \fIfilename\fP already exists, it is appended to.
.TP
.BI "\-M \fIURL\fP, \-\-Meta \fIURL\fP"
Specifies the \fIURL\fP of the metaserver to connect to. A metaserver is a
place where Freeciv servers can publish their presence. Freeciv clients consult
the metaserver to offer users a selection of games to join. By default, the 
standard metaserver run by the Freeciv maintainers will be used. 
.TP
.BI "\-n \fIname\fP, \-\-name \fIname\fP"
Specifies the user name (\fIname\fP) to use to connect to the server. This
option is critical when reconnecting to a game. Please note that you might
need to quote your username.
.TP
.BI "\-p \fIport\fP, \-\-port \fIport\fP"
Specifies the server \fIport\fP to connect to. By default this is 5556, if in 
doubt ask the server administrator.
.TP
.BI "\-P \fIstring\fP, \-\-Plugin \fIstring\fP"
Specifies the plugin to use for sound output.  Available options  for 
\fIstring\fP are:

\fBnone\fP

\fBsdl\fP

.TP
.BI "\-r \fIfilename\fP, \-\-read \fIfilename\fP"
Specifies a file, \fIfilename\fP, of server commands which a server spawned
by the client will automatically read and process, as if you had typed them in
at the server's prompt.
.TP
.BI "\-s \fIaddress\fP, \-\-server \fIaddress\fP"
Specifies the game server \fIaddress\fP to connect to. This server might easily
run on the same machine as the client.
.TP
.BI "\-S \fIname\fP, \-\-Sound \fIname\fP"
Specifies the sound set to use. A file called \fIname\fP.soundspec is searched
for in the usual places (see the \fIFILES\fP section).
.TP
.BI "\-t \fIname\fP, \-\-tiles \fIname\fP"
Specifies the map graphics ("tiles") to be used within the game. A file called
\fIname\fP.tilespec is searched for in the usual places (see the \fIFILES\fP
section). Currently the following tilespecs are distributed with Freeciv:

\(bu
.I amplio2.tilespec

\(bu
.I cimpletoon.tilespec

\(bu
.I hex2t.tilespec

\(bu
.I isophex.tilespec

\(bu
.I isotrident.tilespec

\(bu
.I trident.tilespec
.TP
.BI "\-v, \-\-version"
Prints the version number and exits.
.TP
.BI "\-\-"
All parameters following this \fI\-\-\fP will be considered as client-specific
parameters.
.TP
.BI "\-\- \-f, \-\- \-\-fullscreen"
Starts the client in full screen mode.  Only implemented in the
\fBfreeciv-sdl2\fP client.
.TP
.BI "\-\- \-h, \-\- \-\-help"
Print the client-specific parameter help.
.TP
.BI "\-\- \-r \fIWIDTHxHEIGHT\fP, \-\- \-\-resolution \fIWIDTHxHEIGHT\fP"
Behave as if screen resolution were WIDTHxHEIGHT. Only implemented in the
\fBfreeciv-gtk3\fP and \fBfreeciv-gtk3.22\fP clients.
.TP
.BI "\-\- \-t \fItheme\fP, \-\- \-\-theme \fItheme\fP"
Use a particular GUI theme. Only implemented in the
\fBfreeciv-sdl2\fP client.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.TP
.B "freeciv-gtk3 \-\-name ""King Richard"" \-\-server io.daimi.aau.dk"
Starts the GTK3 client using the name \fIKing Richard\fP and connecting
to the server at \fIio.daimi.aau.dk\fP.
.TP
.B freeciv-sdl2 \-a \-t trident
Starts the SDL2-client with the \fItrident\fP tiles and autoconnects to
\fIlocalhost\fP.
.SH FILES
.TP
.BI ~/.freeciv/freeciv-client-rc-\fI[version-number]\fP
This is where your local settings will be stored.
.TP
.BI tilespecs
These are searched for in the data path; see \fIENVIRONMENT\fP.
.TP
.BI soundspecs
These are searched for in the data path; see \fIENVIRONMENT\fP.
.PP
The
.IR freeciv-modpack (6)
utility can be used to locate and download additional content such as
tilesets and soundsets and (for client-spawned servers only) scenarios
and rulesets; it saves files under ~/.freeciv .
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The Freeciv client accepts these environment variables:
.TP
.BI FREECIV_CAPS
A string containing a list of "capabilities" provided by the server. The
compiled-in default should be correct for most purposes, but if you are familiar
with the capability facility in the source you may use it to enforce some
constraints between clients and server.
.TP
.BI FREECIV_COMPRESSION_LEVEL
Sets the compression level for network traffic.
.TP
.BI FREECIV_DATA_ENCODING
Sets the character encoding used for data files, savegames, and network
strings). This should not normally be changed from the default of UTF-8,
since that is the format of the supplied rulesets and the standard
network protocol.
.TP
.BI FREECIV_INTERNAL_ENCODING
Sets the character encoding used internally by the \fBfreeciv\fP client.
This generally needs to match the GUI toolkit, so its default depends
on the specific client; most clients default to UTF-8.
.TP
.BI FREECIV_LOCAL_ENCODING
Sets the local character encoding (used for the command line and terminal
output). The default is inferred from other aspects of the environment.
.TP 
.BI FREECIV_MULTICAST_GROUP
Sets the multicast group (for the LAN tab).
.TP
.BI FREECIV_DATA_PATH
A colon separated list of directories pointing to the
.B freeciv
data directories. By default Freeciv looks in the following directories,
in order, for any data files: the current directory; the "data" subdirectory
of the current directory; the subdirectory ".freeciv/@DATASUBDIR@" in the user's
home directory; and the directory where the files are placed by running
"make install".  If not set,
.BI FREECIV_SAVE_PATH
A colon separated list of directories pointing to the
.B freeciv
save directories. By default Freeciv looks in the following directories,
in order, for save files: the current directory; and the subdirectory
".freeciv/saves" in the user's home directory.

(This does not affect where the server spawned by the client creates save
game files; these are always created in ".freeciv/saves" in the user's
home directory.)
.TP
.BI FREECIV_SCENARIO_PATH
A colon separated list of directories pointing to the
.B freeciv
scenario directories. By default Freeciv looks in the following directories,
in order, for scenario files: the current directory; the "data/scenarios"
subdirectory of the current directory; the subdirectories
".freeciv/@DATASUBDIR@/scenarios" and then ".freeciv/scenarios"
in the user's home directory; and the directory where the files are placed
by running "make install".

(This does not affect where the server spawned by the client creates scenario
files; these are always created in ".freeciv/scenarios" in the user's
home directory.)
.TP
.BI FREECIV_OPT
Specifies a file to contain local settings, instead of
~/.freeciv/freeciv-client-rc-\fI[version-number]\fP.
.TP
.BI HOME
Specifies the user's home directory.
.TP
.BI http_proxy
Set this variable accordingly when using a proxy.
.TP
\fBLANG\fP  or  \fBLANGUAGE\fP
Sets the language and locale on some platforms.
.TP
\fBLC_ALL\fP  or  \fBLC_CTYPE\fP
Similar to LANG (see documentation for your system).
.TP
.BI USER
Specifies the username of the current user.
